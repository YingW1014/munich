# MUNICH version 2.0.1 release (2022-01-05)

## Model

- Added a new parametrization for wind speed and vertical transfer coefficient based on Wang (2012; 2014). 
- Correction of the formulations to compute wind speed at roof level (uH) and
  wind speed attenuation in the street.

## Bug fixes

- Use a minimum value for transfer_velocity to avoid the zero division.
- Corrected the array size for diam_input


# MUNICH version 2.0 release (2021-09-01)

## Model

- Added a new parametrization for the aerosol resuspension.
- Implemented SSH-Aerosol as a sub module for the modeling of secondary
  aerosols using API of SSH-Aerosol. 
- Added a new option for SVOC deposition
- Added a new option for the computation of friction velocity and wind speed.
- Added a new gas-phase kinetic mechanism CHIMERE/MELCHIOR2.

## Preprocessing

- Added option for the speciation of particle and ISVOC emissions.
- Improved in CPU time by rewriting the function arc_streets_same.
- Map projection type can be selected.

## Environment

- Talos/AtmoData/SeldonData changed as a sub module.
- atmopy added as a sub module.
- Conversion to Python3 format.


# Version 1.1.beta is implemented on AmpliSIM platform (2021-05-15).

AmpliSIM platform provides users a GUI environment to run MUNICH simulations.

Version 1.1 (2020-02-14)
-------------

** Processing

- Parallelized 'Chemistry' part using MPI.

** Models

- Added non-stationary calculation using ETR (Lya Lugon) and Rosenbrock (Mofan
  Zhang) methods.

** Bug fixes

- A formula missed in Leighton chemistry scheme.

** Development environment

- Reorganization of files: processing/photochemistry made for the gas-phase
  chemistry. An other processing will be added for the aerosol chemistry later.

Version 1.0 (2018-09-29)
-------------

** First stable version released as a part of Polyphemus 1.11


Version beta (2017-09-04)
-------------

** First git commit by Youngseob Kim
