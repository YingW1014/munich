Desciption
----------

This Python script is made to prepare input data of a MUNICH simulation.

The input data consist of
 - Traffic emission (which can be provided by a traffic model)
 - Street canyon configuration: street width, building height
 - Overlying background concentration
 - Meteoroloigcal data (from WRF) 

1. Traffic emission
The script needs emission data for both the weekday and the weekend.
For each type of data, hourly data are necessary. For example, the input file input/data-newref/EL.traf.2014032500 includes emission data for March 25 2014 at midnight.
Because March 25 2014 is on Tuesday, this data is used for the weekday from
Monday to Friday.

2. Street canyon configuration (see input/street-geog-info.dat)
The input file has beed manually prepared using QGIS with BDTopo database.
The street width is calculated by the following formulation:

street width = (mean lane width) x (number of lanes) + (mean larger of pavement)

The builiding height is obtained using QGIS for each street segment. An
averaged value is calculated for minor street segments.

3. Overling background concentration (see
   input/airparif_background_concentration.dat)
Hourly concentrations are obtained using measured values at air monitoring
stations.

4. Meteoroloigcal data (see input/meteo/wrfout_d04_***)
Hourly saved WRF output data are used. The prefix of the WRF data should be
informed in sing_preproc.cfg file.


Requirement
-----------

- numpy
- python3-netcdf4


Configuration file (sing_preproc.cfg)
-------------------------------------
t_min: begining hour
Delta_t: time step
Nt: number of iterations

emission_dir_weekday: directory for emission data files on weekday
emission_dir_weekend: directory for emission data files on weekend
emission_species: list of speceis which are defined in the emission data
files (see input/data-newref/EL.traf.2014032500).

input_dir: directory for input files.
geog_info: input file for street configurations.
background_concentration: input file for background concentrations.
meteo_dir: WRF output files for meteo data.
wrfout_prefix: prefix of WRF files.

Output_dir: directory for output files.

Date_min_polair: begining hour of Polair3d simulation (used for SinG)
Delta_t_polair : time step of Polair3d simulation (used for SinG)
Nt_polair: number of iterations of Polair3d simulation (used for SinG)
x_min, Delta_x, Nx, ymin, Delta_y, Ny: domain definition of Polair3d
simulation (used for SinG)

Run
---

> python sing_preproc.py sing_preproc.cfg


Output files
------------

The script generates multiple output files in Output_dir of
sing_preproc.cfg. They consisi of the following binary or test files:

- grid-based emission data: all species (used for SinG)
- background: NO, NO2 and O3
- emission: all species
- meteo
  * for street canyons: Attenuation  SurfacePressure UST WindDirection WindSpeed LMO PBLH SpecificHumidity SurfaceTemperature
  * for street intersection: LMOInter  PBLHInter USTInter WindDirectionInter WindSpeedInter
- textfile
  * emission-trafipollu-eff.20140630-23.txt: emission data for each hour.
  * node-trafipollu-eff.txt: intersection coordinates
  * These fils are necessary for the visualization of data (see the folder /postprocessing)

The dimesion of data except the grid-based emission data is 
  Number of street segment x number of iteration
